Host: There are several challenges and drawbacks of using web3 technologies. Firstly, there is a steep learning curve associated with these technologies. They require a significant amount of technical knowledge and expertise, which can be a barrier to entry for many people.

Secondly, web3 technologies are still in their early stages of development, and there are still many bugs and glitches that need to be ironed out. This can lead to issues with security and reliability, which can be a major concern for users.

Another challenge is the issue of interoperability. Many web3 technologies are built on different platforms and use different protocols, which can make it difficult for them to work seamlessly together.

Finally, there is the issue of scalability. As more and more users adopt web3 technologies, there is a risk that the network will become congested and slow. This can lead to performance issues and can ultimately limit the growth and adoption of these technologies.
