# AI Interview Bot

# Introduction

This project is an AI-powered interview system designed to simulate a dynamic interview experience using multiple AI agents. The system is built on top of the GPT-4 architecture and aims to create an interactive and engaging interview environment. The project features a host, a Q&A provider, and several other agents, such as a content moderation bot, that work together to facilitate the conversation.

The key features of the project include:
- A modular design that allows for easy addition and customization of agents.
- A web-based user interface built using JointJS for designing the routing logic between agents.
- A routing mediator that interprets the configuration generated by the web UI and manages the interactions between agents.
- Exporting the interview transcript as an SRT file using the SRTLogger.

# Architecture

The high-level architecture of the project can be broken down into the following components:

- **Main Application**: The main application script (main.py) is responsible for running the conversation loop, taking input from the user (guest), and managing the interactions between the agents.

- **Host**: The host (host.py) is an AI-powered entity responsible for managing the interview and interacting with the user. It receives input from the Q&A provider and other agents and responds accordingly.

- **Q&A Provider**: The Q&A provider (qa_provider.py) generates relevant questions based on the input provided by the user. It uses the GPT-4 architecture to understand the context and generate questions dynamically.

- **Agents**: The agents are individual AI-powered entities designed to assist the host in specific tasks. They can be added or customized as needed. Examples include the content moderation bot, a sentiment analysis bot, or any other agent that enhances the conversation.

- **Web UI**: The web-based user interface (built using JointJS) allows users to design the routing logic between agents visually. Users can create, connect, and configure nodes representing agents and their interactions.

- **Routing Mediator**: The routing mediator interprets the configuration generated by the web UI and manages the interactions between the agents. It ensures that the messages flow between agents as designed by the user.

- **SRTLogger**: The SRTLogger (srt_logger.py) is responsible for logging the conversation and exporting it as an SRT file, which can be used for subtitles or transcriptions.

These components work together to create an interactive and engaging interview experience. The modular design of the project allows for easy addition and customization of agents, providing flexibility and adaptability to different scenarios and requirements.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- Python 3.8 or later
- An OpenAI API key with access to GPT-4 (You can sign up for one at https://beta.openai.com/signup/)
- The following Python libraries: openai, python-dotenv, and JointJS (for the web UI)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-interview-system.git
cd ai-interview-system
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the project root directory and add your OpenAI API key:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

4. Run the web UI to design the routing logic between agents:

```
python ui.py
```

5. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to access the web UI.

6. After designing the routing logic, export the configuration and save it as `routing_config.json` in the project root directory.

7. Run the main application:

```
python main.py
```

8. Interact with the AI-powered interview system through the command-line interface.

# Usage

To use the AI-powered interview system, follow these steps:

1. Run the main application (`python main.py`). The host will greet you and ask for a topic for discussion.

2. As a guest, provide a topic or a statement. The Q&A provider will generate questions based on your input, and the host will select one at random.

3. The routing mediator will manage the interactions between agents according to the routing logic designed in the web UI. The host will receive input from the agents and respond to the guest accordingly.

4. To end the conversation, type "stop".

5. After the conversation ends, the SRTLogger will save the transcript as an SRT file (transcript.srt) in the project root directory.

# Customizing and Adding Agents

To customize existing agents or add new ones, follow these steps:

1. Create a new Python file for the agent in the `agents` directory.

2. Define a class for the agent that inherits from the `Agent` base class (agent_base.py). Implement the required methods, such as `process_input` and `generate_output`.

3. Update the `agent_classes` dictionary in the `agent_factory.py` file to include your new agent class.

4. Add the new agent to the web UI by updating the `jointConfig.js` file. Define a new node type for the agent and include it in the `shapes` object.

5. Design the routing logic using the web UI to include the new agent in the conversation flow. Export the configuration and save it as `routing_config.json`.

6. Run the main application to see your new agent in action.

By following these steps, you can easily add or customize agents to enhance the capabilities of the AI-powered interview system.

# Testing

To test the AI-powered interview system, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have a `.env` file with a valid OpenAI API key in the project root directory.

2. Run the test suite using the following command:

```
python -m unittest
```

This command will execute the test cases defined in the `tests` directory. Each test case covers a specific functionality or integration within the system. Make sure that all tests pass before deploying the project.

# Deployment

To deploy the AI-powered interview system, you can use the following options:

- Package the application into a standalone executable using tools like PyInstaller or cx_Freeze. This can be distributed and run on other systems without requiring the user to install Python or other dependencies.

- Host the application on a cloud server or platform-as-a-service (PaaS) provider, such as Heroku or AWS Elastic Beanstalk. This enables the system to be accessed from anywhere with an internet connection.

- Containerize the application using Docker and deploy it to a container orchestration platform like Kubernetes or Amazon ECS. This allows for efficient scaling and management of resources in a production environment.
